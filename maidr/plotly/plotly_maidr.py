    Membership in :data:`_PLACED_BY_DOMAIN` is the type-level half of the

    grid describes what maidr can describe, so a trace it draws no layer for
    occupies no cell -- reserving one would both add an empty cell to tab
    through and shift every renderable subplot beside it into a different
    column.

    Each family answers that with the same rule its extractor uses to form a
    layer, so the two cannot disagree. An indicator is read only when it
    draws a dial, so a ``mode="number"`` one is a domain trace that renders
    nothing, exactly like a ``go.Table``. A hierarchy is read only when it has
    one root. A pie or funnelarea is read only when it draws a wedge: #638
    made an empty one form no layer, and until #702 this still handed it a
    cell, so a figure with an empty pie beside a bar tabbed through an empty
    first column before reaching the bar in its second.

    A trace that draws nothing forms no layer. #421 established that for the
    line and area families, by excluding an undrawn trace from their groupings
    with ``draws_marks()`` -- which does more than this, because it also keeps
    the *positions* of the surviving series contiguous, something a later
    filter cannot recover. Every other family appended unconditionally, so an
    empty pie, sankey, hierarchy, polar or parcoords became a layer with an
    empty payload (#636).

    That is not a harmless no-op. It is a cell the reader can tab into and
    find nothing in, and for the line-family types it is worse: `LineTrace`
    dereferences an undefined point on an empty series and throws, which
    propagates out of `Figure` and takes the whole render down
    (xability/maidr#905). `ParallelTrace` and `RadarTrace` are both built on
    it.

    Asked of the *rendered* payload rather than of the trace, so one question
    covers all three shapes maidr emits: a list of points, a list of series,
    and a mapping. `plot.schema` is memoised, so this costs no extra work.

    A mapping needs the extra step, because two of them look alike at the top
    level and mean opposite things. A gauge's is
    ``{"value": 0, "min": -1, "max": 1}`` -- a full reading whose first field
    happens to be falsy -- and an empty heatmap's is ``{"points": []}``, a
    field with nothing in it. So a mapping carries data when any of its values
    is a scalar or a non-empty collection.

    One level, deliberately. ``{"points": [[]]}`` -- a heatmap of one empty
    row -- is kept, because recursing to decide that a nested structure is
    "really" empty is guessing at a shape rather than reading it, and dropping
    a layer that should have shipped is the more damaging of the two mistakes.

          ``'group'``, ``'stack'`` or ``'relative'`` -- are merged into a
          single :class:`PlotlyGroupedBarPlot`. ``'overlay'`` is not combined:
          those bars are drawn over one another rather than joined, so they
          stay separate layers.
        * Scatter/lines traces are split by *renderer* first — SVG traces
          apart from canvas-painted ``scattergl`` ones — because a layer's
          selector list is all-or-nothing, so a mixed layer could only claim a
          highlight for every series or for none. The groups are built in
          first-seen order, so the emitted layers still follow plotly's own
          trace order. Grouping is coarse rather than interleaved: traces
          alternating ``svg, gl, svg`` emit ``[svg, svg]`` then ``[gl]``,
          because both SVG traces belong to one merged layer. That is
          inherent to merging at all, and matches how
          :func:`~maidr.plotly.step_shape.group_by_direction` already behaves
          for alternating step conventions.
        * Within a renderer they are split into staircases and plain lines by
          ``line.shape``: a step merged into the line layer would be
          announced as interpolating between samples, which is the one thing
          piecewise-constant data does not do. The plain lines then merge into
          a single :class:`PlotlyMultiLinePlot` (matching ``MultiLinePlot``),
          or become one :class:`PlotlyLinePlot` when there is only one.
        * The staircases are split again by step convention, one
          :class:`PlotlyStepPlot` per convention, because a MAIDR layer
          carries a single ``stepDirection`` for all of its series.
        * Multiple box traces are merged into a single
          :class:`PlotlyMultiBoxPlot` (matching ``BoxPlot``).
        * Pie traces stay one layer each, but are built here rather than by
          the factory so every pie carries its position among the figure's
          pie traces — the only thing its selector can be scoped by.
        * Waterfall traces stay one layer each for the same reason, scoped by
          their position among the subplot's waterfall traces.

        Every scatter-family trace is assigned a selector index from its
        position within the subplot, not within the layer it lands in — see
        :meth:`PlotlyPlot._scatter_line_selector`. Because of that, all
        scatter/lines traces are built here rather than left to
        :class:`PlotlyPlotFactory`, which cannot know those positions.

        The output includes:

        1. The interactive Plotly chart (plotly.js loaded from CDN)
        2. A bridge script that waits for Plotly to render, injects the
           MAIDR schema into the SVG, and (in online mode) loads the
           MAIDR JS bundle.

        No MAIDR stylesheet is emitted: the accessibility UI is styled at
        runtime, and KaTeX -- the one stylesheet with rules in it -- is
        fetched by ``maidr.js`` from wherever it was itself loaded.
