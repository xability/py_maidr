#: Layer classes a segmented bar layer on the same axes can supersede.
#:
#: ``GroupedBarPlot`` reads every ``BarContainer`` on its axes, so it already
#: describes whatever a ``BarPlot`` beside it would -- whether that ``BarPlot``
#: swept the axes too (the seaborn path) or narrowed to the one container its
#: own ``ax.bar()`` call drew (the matplotlib path, since #380). Either way the
#: segmented layer covers it, which is what makes it superseded.
#:
#: Asked by class rather than by ``plot.type``, and that distinction is not
#: pedantic: ``MplfinanceBarPlot`` also carries ``PlotType.BAR``, and it reads
#: the volume patches handed to it rather than sweeping the axes. A type-based
#: check would have made it eligible to be dropped by a stacked bar sharing
#: its axes, on a premise that is not true of it. ``HistPlot`` draws bars and
#: reads its own container too. Neither subclasses the two below, so neither
#: is in the family.

class Maidr:
    """
    A class to handle the rendering and interaction
    of matplotlib figures with additional metadata.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _fig : Figure
        The matplotlib figure associated with this instance.
    _plots : list[MaidrPlot]
        A list of MaidrPlot objects which hold additional plot-specific configurations.
    _cached_version : str | None
        Cached version of maidr from npm registry to avoid repeated API calls.

    Methods
    -------
    render(lib_prefix=None, include_version=True)
        Creates and returns a rendered HTML representation of the figure.
    save_html(file, lib_dir=None, include_version=True)
        Saves the rendered HTML representation to a file.
    show(renderer='auto')
        Displays the rendered HTML content in the specified rendering context.

    Notes
    -----
    Since #456 this object is stored on its own figure, so **everything held
    here and on every :class:`~maidr.core.plot.MaidrPlot` participates in
    that figure's pickle and deepcopy**. Before, the registry lived off the
    figure and a figure was picklable regardless of maidr's state.

    So an unpicklable attribute -- a lock, a generator, an open handle, a
    closure kept on ``self`` rather than used within one call -- would break
    ``pickle.dumps(fig)`` for a plain-looking figure that merely happens to
    have been plotted through maidr, somewhere the user has no reason to
    look. Nothing enforces this; ``tests/core/test_figure_manager.py``
    round-trips a figure through both, which is what would notice.

        anything. It used to be maintained as a figure-wide "highest priority
        type seen" and consulted to decide whether bar layers should be
        collapsed, which is how a stacked bar in one panel came to delete
        layers from every other panel (#376). The question is asked per

        The lock is here rather than in the integrations because this is
        where the mutation is: ``savefig`` writes ``self._fig.dpi`` for its
        duration and restores it, so two renders of one figure at once race
        on that attribute and the loser draws the whole chart at the other
        call's dpi -- a complete, well-formed SVG at the wrong scale, with
        nothing raised (#454).

        Every render of a ``matplotlib`` figure funnels through here:
        ``render``, ``save_html`` and ``_create_html_doc`` all call it, and
        none of them re-enters it. Holding it at this one point is what
        makes a plain ``Lock`` safe -- a second lock at a caller would
        deadlock against this one rather than nest.

        The Shiny and Streamlit integrations held this lock themselves
        until #532. That covered the two doors this package ships and
        nothing else: a Flask app -- Werkzeug serves threaded, and
        ``Environment.is_flask`` makes it a supported embedding -- or any
        caller rendering from a thread pool met the same race with no lock
        at all. Measured through ``maidr.render`` with no widget involved,
        six threads on one figure: 1 of 5 trials came back with two
        distinct outputs.

        The lock covers the whole render rather than the ``savefig`` call
        alone. That is wider than the mutation strictly needs, and
        deliberate: the schema is extracted from the same artists
        ``savefig`` is writing, so a narrower lock would let one render's
        payload be built while another render mutates the figure under it.
        It is also what the two doors held before this, so nothing about
        contention changes for them. In a single-threaded script the lock
        is never contended and costs an uncontended acquire per render.

        Locking by ``self._fig`` also removes a resolution step that could
        disagree with the render. The integrations had to work out *which*
        figure a value named before they could lock it, and when that

        registered against two axes is not something this change measured. The
        scoping is left as it was; only the bookkeeping moves, so that these
        drops go through the same lockstep filter as the rest.

        This rule alone cannot fire on the pass's *first* run.
        ``_smooth_gid`` is assigned during extraction, which is what reading
        ``plot.elements`` triggers -- so when ``_create_html_tag`` runs the

        artists keep a tag no schema layer references, which is inert, and
        the surviving layers keep their own ids because the filter is

        stacked chart built from three ``ax.bar()`` calls registers three
        layers that each describe the whole chart. One has to survive and the
        rest are duplicates.

        Which one survives is the part that was wrong. This used to key off
        ``self.plot_type`` -- a *figure-wide* "highest priority type seen",
        where ``STACKED``/``DODGED`` outrank everything -- and then keep
        ``position_plots[0]``, the first layer registered at each position
        whatever its type. Three things followed, none of which errored (#376):

        * a stacked bar in one panel collapsed **every** panel to its first
          layer, so an unrelated scatter overlay in the next panel along
          simply stopped being announced;
        * which layer survived was registration order, so a reference line
          drawn before the bars meant the bar chart was the thing dropped;
        * matplotlib's own documented stacked bar -- ``bottom`` omitted on the
          first call, as everyone writes it -- registered ``BAR`` then
          ``STACKED``, kept the ``BAR``, and that layer's extractor then found
          six patches against three tick labels and raised ``ExtractionError``,
          which is fatal to the whole figure. Passing ``bottom=np.zeros(n)``
          on the first call avoided it, which is why every test wrote it that
          way.

        So the question is asked per *axes*, and it is asked once. Three rules
        used to answer it in three places, each filtering ``_plots`` on its
        own; they are gathered here so there is one filter and one statement
        of the pairing invariant below. See ``_layer_axes_key`` for why the
        axes and not the grid cell.

        Idempotent, and it has to be: it runs from ``_create_html_tag`` before
        the elements are collected *and* from ``_flatten_maidr``, which can be
        called on its own.

        ``selector_ids`` is filtered in step with ``_plots``. The two are
        paired by index in both directions -- ``_create_html_tag`` tags each
        layer's artists with ``selector_ids[i]``, and ``_flatten_maidr``
        stamps the same index into the layer's selector string -- so dropping
        a layer without dropping its id hands every surviving layer its
        neighbour's, and the highlight lands on the wrong mark with nothing
        raised. Two of the three rules gathered here did exactly that.
