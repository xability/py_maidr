def test_concurrent_renders_of_one_figure_agree():
    """Streamlit runs every session in its own thread; this door had no lock.

    ``savefig`` writes ``fig.dpi`` for its duration and restores it
    afterwards, so two renders of the **same** figure at once race on one
    mutable attribute and the loser draws the whole chart at the other
    call's dpi (#454). The Shiny renderer has held a per-figure lock since
    #504. Nothing held one here, and Streamlit is if anything more exposed:
    it runs each session's script on its own ScriptRunner thread, and
    ``@st.cache_resource`` is its documented way to share one object --
    a figure included -- across them.

    Measured on the shipped path before the fix: 1 of 30 concurrent renders
    came back as a complete, well-formed SVG of the same chart at the wrong
    scale, ``L 640 -134.4`` where every other render had ``L 460.8 0``. Not
    garbled markup and not an exception -- geometry is what the highlight
    overlay and the tactile export are positioned against, so a chart at
    72% scale is wrong in the modality a sighted reviewer checks least.

    Asserted as agreement between renders rather than against a fixed size,
    since the wrong-dpi output is internally consistent: it is only wrong
    relative to what every other render produced.

    The barrier synchronises the *start*, not the duration, so on a runner
    slow enough that each render finishes before the next thread is
    scheduled this passes with a broken lock -- a false negative rather
    than CI noise. Measured 10 of 10 runs mismatching with the lock
    removed and 10 of 10 identical with it.
