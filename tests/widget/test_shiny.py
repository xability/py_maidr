    Measured with that state as plain class attributes: four concurrent
    renders of distinct figures went from 61 selectors each to
    ``[7, 1, 1, 1]``. Valid SVGs, with the interactive layer silently
    gone -- and only on concurrent traffic, so it would not reproduce from
    a bug report.

    Counts selectors rather than comparing whole documents, because ids
    are per-render uuids; the count is what goes missing.

    """Concurrent renders of one figure must produce the same chart.

    Narrower than it first looks, and worth stating plainly:
    ``test_two_renders_of_one_figure_do_not_overlap`` above already fails
    without the lock, so this is not filling an unguarded gap. That one
    monkeypatches ``maidr.render`` to a sleeping stub, so it proves the
    lock *excludes* but cannot see what the exclusion is protecting. This
    runs the real render and asserts the consequence.

    ``savefig`` writes ``fig.dpi`` for its duration and restores it
    afterwards, so two renders of the **same** figure at once race on one
    mutable attribute and the loser draws the whole chart at the other
    call's dpi (#454). Distinct figures do not race; that is why the lock
    is per figure rather than process-wide.

    The failure is the kind this project treats as worst: not garbled
    markup and not an exception, but a complete, well-formed SVG of the
    same chart at the wrong size. Geometry is what the highlight overlay
    and the tactile export are positioned against, so a chart rendered at
    72% scale is wrong in the modality a sighted reviewer checks least.

    Asserted as agreement between renders rather than against a fixed size,
    since the wrong-dpi output is internally consistent -- it is only wrong
    relative to what every other render produced.

    The barrier synchronises the *start*, not the duration. On a runner
    slow or oversubscribed enough that each ``savefig`` finishes before
    the next thread is scheduled, this would pass with a broken lock --
    a false negative rather than a flaky failure, so it would show up as
    quietly reduced coverage rather than as CI noise. Measured 8 of 8
    detections here with the lock removed; the sibling test above detects
    overlap regardless of speed and is the one to trust on a bad day.

    Scope: **geometry, not data.** ``_VOLATILE_IN_SVG`` strips every
    ``maidr="..."`` attribute, and the one on the root ``<svg>`` carries
    the whole embedded schema, so a race that scrambled the announced
    values without moving a coordinate would pass this. The bug it guards
    is about ``fig.dpi``, which lives entirely in the ``<path d="...">``
    data the regex leaves alone.

    Measured 10 of 10 runs mismatching with the lock stubbed out and 10 of
    10 identical with it, so this runs in CI rather than under
    ``--run-benchmark``.

    The renders start from a barrier rather than from whenever each thread
    happens to be scheduled. Review raised the right worry -- a quiet or
    single-core runner could let six staggered renders complete without
    ever landing inside each other's ``dpi`` window, which would reduce
    this to a no-op that still passes. Raising the chart size does not
    address that (detection was 8 of 8 at 30, 100 and 200 bars alike, so
    the margin was never the variable); starting them together does,
    because it does not depend on the scheduler being busy.

    Parametrised over what the render function returns because the two
    used to be different: a ``Figure`` resolves to a *list* of axes, and
    the old resolver read ``.figure`` off that list, got ``None``, and
    took a fresh unshared lock -- so an app whose render function returned
    ``fig`` rather than ``ax`` raced exactly as if there were no lock. Both
    now resolve to the same figure, and so to the same lock.
